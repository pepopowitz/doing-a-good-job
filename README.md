## You're doing a good job!

And this new tab extension knows it.

This is a new tab extension that displays a nice image, and an uplifting message.

## Running as an extension

1. Clone the project to get the source.
2. Follow the instructions to load an [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked) from the source.
3. Configure the plugin by clicking the ðŸ˜˜ in your browser extension bar:

   1. Add an Unsplash API key (configure it at https://unsplash.com/developers)
   2. Add items of praise as Markdown. Separate items with `---`. Items will be randomly rotated on each new tab.
   3. Click the "Update" button to save the changes.
5. Open a new tab, and it should look like this (though the praise doesn't appear for 20 seconds, so that people don't think I'm an egomaniac when I'm sharing my screen):
